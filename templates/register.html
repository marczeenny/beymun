          <h3>International Delegates</h3>
          <p>For this year's edition, we have chosen the <a href="https://mymun.com/conferences/beymun-2025">mymun</a> platform for international delegates and delegations. The BEYMUN 2025 page is accessible at <a href="{{ url_for('mymun') }}" target="_blank">mun.org.lb/int</a>.<br>
          The fees for international delegates amount to <strong>USD 60</strong> to be paid through WesternUnion. You will receive (by email) the payment coordinates once you register on MyMun.</p>
          <h3>National Delegates</h3>
          <p>Delegates may register for the conference by filling the form at <a href="{{ url_for('delegate_regist') }}">mun.org.lb{{ url_for('delegate_regist') }}</a>. Registration closes on the 7th of April 2025.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700">Note: Payment of the registration fee should be made in anticipation of filling the registration form, as the Whish receipt is to be attached.</span></p>
          <h5>Payment</h5>
          <p>Fees for national delegates: <strong>USD 30</strong> (USD 20 for AUB Students)<br>
          Payment can be made either through the Whish app or the BobFinance app by searching for "Beymun AUB". Make sure you are in the USD section if you're using Whish.<br>
          Regarding delegates who do not have a Whish or BobFinance account, you can always pay at any of their physical stores throughout Lebanon, by simply indicating BEYMUN AUB.<br>As always, for any inquiry, do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:beymun@aub.edu.lb">beymun@aub.edu.lb</a>.<br>
          Please note that the registration fee is NOT refundable.</p>

          <h5>Delegations</h5>
            <p>In addition to each delegate filling the form mentionned above, delegates can choose to represent their school by letting an advisor fill the form at <a href="{{ url_for('skl_regist') }}">mun.org.lb{{ url_for('skl_regist') }}</a>.<br>
            Advisors will have to also upload a spreadsheet containing the first, middle, and last names of the delegation's members, each in a separate column.<br>
            There is NO restriction on the number of delegates per delegation, however the maximum number of Advisors per delegation is two, with a main one and a secondary one.</p>
